Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Redis key prefix support** — relay server now reads `REDIS_PREFIX` env var and prepends it to all Redis keys (`bridge:req:*`, `bridge:stream:*`), ensuring correct key resolution when Laravel uses a prefix on its bridge Redis connection.
- **Executor diagnostic logging** — Claude Code executor logs process PID, line counts, event kinds, and scanner errors to stderr for production debugging.
- **Debug-level event tracing** — runner logs streaming events at DEBUG level for troubleshooting without noise in production.
- **stderr passthrough** — Claude Code subprocess stderr is forwarded to the bridge daemon log for visibility into agent errors.

### Fixed

- **Claude Code authentication in LaunchAgent context** — bridge daemon running under macOS LaunchAgent now has keychain access, enabling Claude Code OAuth session tokens to work correctly. Previously, running via SSH `nohup` lacked keychain context and claude-code exited with "Not logged in".

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added

- **IDE MCP config discovery** — automatically detects MCP server configurations from Claude Code (`~/.claude.json`), Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`), and Windsurf (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`). Discovered configs are sent to FleetQ cloud alongside local MCP servers.
- **Purpose-aware agent execution** — agents receive a `purpose` field from the relay. When purpose is `platform_assistant`, Claude Code's built-in tools are disabled so it relies exclusively on FleetQ MCP tools.

### Fixed

- **WebSocket read limit** — increased from 32 KB to 10 MB to handle large agent request payloads (e.g. assistant system prompts with full tool schemas).
- **Claude Code stream-json parsing** — updated for Claude Code 2.1.74+ which changed the streaming event format.
- **Gemini/Codex CLI output format** — executor now handles updated JSON output structure from recent CLI versions.

### Changed

- **Race-free connection registration** — relay server now registers the connection synchronously before starting the read loop, preventing a race where `updateEndpoints` could not find the connection record.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added

- **`--config` flag** — all commands accept `--config <path>` to support multiple bridge instances with separate config files.
- **`--api-url` login flag** — specify the FleetQ server URL directly during login.
- **Relay server Dockerfile** — containerized relay server with CI workflow for building images.
- **Install script** — `curl -sSL https://get.fleetq.net | sh` for quick installation.
- **Cloudflare Worker** — serves the install script at `get.fleetq.net/bridge`.

### Fixed

- **Session ID race** — fixed race condition where endpoints were sent before the session was registered, causing them to be lost.
- **Endpoints format** — corrected the JSON structure to match Laravel's expected nested format (`endpoints.agents`, `endpoints.llm_endpoints`, `endpoints.mcp_servers`).
- **Team ID parsing** — relay now correctly reads `current_team.id` from the `/me` API response.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **TUI dashboard** (`fleetq-bridge tui`) — live terminal UI with three tabs:
  - Status tab: relay connection state, uptime, LLM/agent counts
  - Endpoints tab: per-endpoint online status with model list
  - Logs tab: streaming daemon events
  - Keyboard navigation: `Tab`/`1`–`3` to switch tabs, `j`/`k` to scroll, `q` to quit
- **MCP proxy** — routes MCP tool calls from FleetQ cloud to locally configured MCP servers
  - Configure servers in `~/.config/fleetq/bridge.yaml` under `mcp_servers`
  - `fleetq-bridge mcp list` command lists configured servers
  - Servers start automatically alongside the daemon
- **System tray icon** — menubar icon on macOS/Linux shows connection status at a glance
  - Green dot = connected, grey = disconnected
  - Menu items: Open TUI, Show Logs, Quit
- **Outbound WebSocket relay** — persistent WSS connection to FleetQ cloud
  - Heartbeat keepalive with automatic reconnect on disconnect
  - Session registration via `POST /api/v1/bridge/register`
  - Endpoint manifest pushed to cloud via `POST /api/v1/bridge/endpoints`
  - Periodic heartbeat via `POST /api/v1/bridge/heartbeat`

### Changed

- Agent executors now support streaming output via PTY (pseudo-terminal)
- Discovery probe interval is configurable (`discovery.interval_seconds` in config)

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Daemon** (`fleetq-bridge daemon`) — persistent background process
- **Auto-discovery** — probes local ports for LLM inference servers:
  - Ollama (`:11434`), LM Studio (`:1234`), Jan.ai (`:1337`), LocalAI (`:8080`), GPT4All (`:4891`)
  - Reports discovered models with online/offline status
- **Agent executors** — detects and spawns local coding agents:
  - Claude Code (`claude`), Gemini CLI (`gemini`), OpenCode (`opencode`),
    Cline CLI (`cline`), Cursor (`agent`), Kiro CLI (`kiro-cli`), Aider (`aider`), Codex (`codex`)
- **Service management** — install/uninstall as a system service:
  - macOS: launchd plist (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.fleetq.bridge.plist`)
  - Linux: systemd user unit (`~/.config/systemd/user/fleetq-bridge.service`)
  - Windows: SCM service (via `golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc`)
- **CLI commands**: `login`, `daemon`, `install`, `uninstall`, `status`, `endpoints list/probe`, `logs`
- **Config file** at `~/.config/fleetq/bridge.yaml` with relay URL, discovery interval, agent list, log level
- Cross-platform builds: macOS (arm64/amd64), Linux (amd64), Windows (amd64)
